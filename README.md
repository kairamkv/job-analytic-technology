## Scrapers

Under the `scraper` folder, there is all the code related to data pipelines which have the task of ingesting data into our database. Currently we are using `MongoDB` as our DB engine, because schema evolution flexibility and the fast iterations that are possible under this model. We are currently scraping data from two sources: `Linkedin` and `StackOverflow`.

## Jobservatory Express

Our backend is an express server (`Nodejs`), from which we implement endpoints for several queries. The related code is under `jobservatory_express` directory. We also cache requests under the assumption that data will not vary faster than 10 minutes, so we have a `redis` cache to improve latency. Our performance tests showed that the reduction in latency was from `400 ms` to `3 ms` on average.

## Jobservatory React

As the name suggests, our frontend is built on `React` framework. Code is under `jobservatory_react`. For manage the states inside the react app we use `Redux`, for UI layouts in general `Chakra-ui`, and for charts we use `Nivo`. Tests are under `react-testing-library` reaching 70%.
